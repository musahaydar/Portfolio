                    Hello! I'm Musa. I'm currently a master's student studying computer science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in music from the University of Michigan in 2022.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm interested in building and testing systems. The coursework I've taken includes distributed systems, computer networks, compilers, and programming languages. During 2021, I participated in research in testing persistent memory systems for crash consistency bugs. Currently, I'm conducting research on symbolic execution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a graduate student instructor for EECS 370: Introduction to Computer Organization. Topics in this course include assembly language programming, compilation and linking, and CPU architecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also a game developer, pixel artist, and composer. During 2021, I was the president of <a href="https://www.wolverinesoft.org">WolverineSoft</a>, the game development student organization at the University of Michigan. You can see some of the games I've made at game jams <a href="https://musahaydar.itch.io">here</a> and some of the music I've composed <a href="https://musahaydar.bandcamp.com">here</a>.
