                    Be Happy is a pair of arcade-style games created for the WolverineSoft 2020 June Game Jam. The theme was "Zoom." I had an idea for the first game to fit the theme, but a tile-matching puzzle game was what I really wanted to make. Since I had a week for the jam, I ended up making both. I think the second game turned out to be a lot of fun! Be Happy was awarded first place.
