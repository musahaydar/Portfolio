                    During my junior year of high school, I took Advanced Java Concepts at Washtenaw Community College. As the final class for that project, we had to create a networked game. My project was One Two Kung Fu, a two-player fighting game inspired by the classic game, Yie Ar Kung-Fu. The project involved socket programming as well as the model-view-controller design pattern for networked user interface systems.
