                    Lunar Respite is moon survival game I created in a week for the WolverineSoft 2020 August Game Jam. The theme was "One Controls Two", which is where the idea of controlling two separated astronauts originated. Lunar Respite was awarded first place.</p><p>Lunar respite is one of my proudest game jam achievements. In addition to all the game's artwork, audio, and music, I managed to implement so many systems that week. This includes an inventory system, a system to persist items in the world and in storage inventories across Unity scenes, various interactive components, player status systems, and so on. I got way too little sleep that week, and it was totally worth it.
