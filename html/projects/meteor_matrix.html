                    Meteor Matrix was my first game ever completed and published. It was a small mobile game created in Unity where the player could tap either side of their screen to move a spaceship and avoid asteroids.</p><p>Meteor Matrix was developed in a couple months, and was published on both the Google Play Store and the iOS App Store. I also implemented a global high score system that saved the best score achieved globally on a server. I released an update for the game in May, 2016.
