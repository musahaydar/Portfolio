                    Crowds! is a puzzle game about getting people indoors. It was made for the 2021 WolverineSoft Summer Game Jam, where the theme was "You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here." I created the music, artwork, and programmed the game, and Logan Hughes created all of the game's sound effects. Crowds! won first place.</p><p>Crowds! is played by placing "impostors" on the board, which affect the people around them. The goal is to get all the people off the board in as few turns and using as few impostors as possible.</p><p>The game is more of a proof of concept, since I didnâ€™t implement a way to share a puzzle so that more than one person can try to optimize a solution. The rules are also rather complicated, and a proper tutorial would help.
