                    <p>Samir Chopra sets out to accomplish two things in <i>Anxiety: A Philosophical Guide</i>: first, to introduce various philosophical understandings of anxiety, and secondly, to implicitly describe how a "philosophical method of some sort" (p. 9) might resolve our suffering of it.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the second objective first, I tend to agree that reframing anxiety "via a new philosophical understanding" can make it comprehensible and manageable: "to philosophize about anxiety is to make it possible that we can change the nature of the beast that lives within us because we understand its presence and roles within our lives differently" (pp. 9-10). Chopra's memoirs, thoughtfully woven throughout the book, illustrate this in recounting his own experiences with anxiety.</p>
                    <p>However, some of Chopra's writing gave me pause and a raised eyebrow: most prominently were his references to philosophers' works (a list which also includes Freud and, broadly, Buddhism) as "doctrines." While studying these may be useful as mentioned, one must recognize that they are workings towards a solution, and ought be treated as such. Many of these works are based on outdated methodologies and perspectives: Chopra recognized, for instance, that Nietzsche was an "unrepentant aristocrat committed to a hierarchy of human types" (p. 70). Freud is another salient example I will discuss further.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, if Chopra has any affinity for analytic philosophy, his words tell us otherwise: he describes philosophers of the analytic tradition as "squabbl[ing], aggressively and pointedly," that they "imagined themselves critical commentators on the physical and social sciences, and that was it," and later that the philosophers whose work would be the subject of this book dealt not just in "abstract instantiations of favored theories, and certainly not just technical analyses of philosophical minutiae" (pp. 30-31).</p>
                    <p>Critics have pointed out the limitations of endless term negotiation and abstractions disconnected from human reality (Charles Mills's " 'Ideal Theory' as Ideology" presents such a case regarding social sciences and modern analytic philosophy). I also confess limited knowledge on the topic. Nevertheless, Chopra's work would have benefited from the analytic tradition's rigor. Perhaps in treating the works discussed as doctrine, Chopra attempts to fit numerous types of "anxiety" (or "angst") where, for instance, Tillich or Freud seemed to have meant something more specific, or possibly different, by the term. Consequently, we find some dismissive turns of phrase, for instance relating "so-called psychotic breakdowns" to Tillich's understanding of the cause of anxiety (p. 98), or that "we may misunderstand or medicate" (p. 104) anxiety as though Heidegger's word on the matter should envelope the variety of such psychiatric diagnoses. It's a weakness of the book, and a cause for confusion, that the very term "anxiety" is not clearly defined and redefined with respect to each thinker or tradition discussed.</p>
                    <p>Then, on the subjects he chose to include, I find Buddhist philosophy an odd choice given the tradition generally seeks to accept, not to "philosophize," the anxiety-causing human condition. However, I think the discussion of Buddhism was perhaps helpful to his second goal, if only categorically unusual when listed amongst specific, Western thinkers. Indeed, a vague overview of Buddhist thought is the closest thing to "philosophical doctrine" here.</p>
                    <p>I cannot say the same for his discussion of Freud. I found his relation of Freud's thought to not only be unconvincing, but lacking any mention of the relevant criticism (Betty Friedan's feminist critique of Freudianism comes to mind). No doubt Freud contributed greatly to psychology and psychotherapy, but does that warrant his theories being applied directly to our lives or to be treated as doctrine? Of course the fear of losing social acceptance, love and support will be a cause for anxiety, and so on. But  does Freud's idea that it is an "echo of an earlier event we found traumatic," in particular tracing back to our very birth, add any clarity? I think it does not.</p>
                    <p>Overall, however, I found some of the information covered in the book to be generally valuable, and the memoirs moving, and so despite this review reading rather negatively thus far, I still think this book provides some generally enjoyable discussion. On account of some of his dismissive phrases, I feared a lack of nuance on the horizon, but nevertheless found Chopra's concluding remarks satisfying. I particularly enjoyed his summary of Marcuse, Marx, and the material causes of anxiety. Thus, I'll close with some of his concluding remarks on that matter: "To live with anxiety in such a world is a task considerably more challenging than simply facing up to it: it requires a fundamental reconfiguration of the ways in which we have chosen to organize our societies [...] And yet, despite this activism, we must learn to introspect, to look deeper into our anxieties and concrete fears to see what else may lurk within" (p. 141).</p>
