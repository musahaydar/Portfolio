                    <div class="quote"><p>"There is just no way for the living creature to avoid life and death, and it is probably poetic justice that if he tries too hard to do so he destroys himself." -Ernest Becker</p></div>
                    <p>Ernest Becker's 1973 book, <i>The Denial of Death</i>, was recommended to me on account of my criticism of Samir Chopra's direct application of Freudian psychology (more on this later). <i>The Denial of Death</i> serves as an introduction to neo-Freudian thought, especially that of Otto Rank. Freud's insights were often limited to sexual or biological motivations; the neo-Freudians worked to recast Freud's thought to broader, existential problems. Take, for instance, the concept of anality: the neo-Freudians argue that the problem encountered by a child's discovery of these bodily functions is really his coming to face with a limited physical body and, by extension, his mortality. Similarly recast, many of Freud's ideas reveal insight into the significance of mortality to human psychology, insight on innate fears about which our awareness of may help us to overcome.</p>
                    <p>While being a fascinating read for a historical understanding of the developments on Freud, I also found the book's thesis (for which the work is titled) to merit reflection as I read. Becker argues that the fear of one's death drives much of human culture and psychology, especially in the modern age when people en-masse no longer rely on religion to address such concerns. His concept of cultural "heroics" is a means to explain human behavior, psychologically and anthropologically, from the level of the individual who seeks immortality through her work up to national politics and the justification of national tyranny.</p>
                    <p>Becker's solution to the problem of mortality is what he calls the closure of Rank and Psychoanalysis on Kierkegaard: the solution of faith. What he finds is that seeking to conquer death through oneself (one's work, art, creativity) or through the other (sex, romance, power) inevitably fails. One cannot conquer mortality through mortal means. Thus, man must look "beyond" this world, into the "highest beyond." Becker sums up the common conclusion of Kierkegaard and Rank as this: "Both men reached the same conclusion after the most exhaustive psychological quest: that at the very furthest reaches of scientific description, psychology has to give way to 'theology'â€”that is, to a world-view that absorbs the individual's conflicts and guilt and offers him the possibility for some kind of heroic apotheosis" (p. 196). He seems awed that this point is made by both "intensive clinical insight" and by "pure Christian ideology." Man must find the solution to his mortality in something greater than life.</p>
                    <p>In writing this, Becker seems open to the varieties of religions or faiths by which one can address the problem of mortality. However, he seems quite sympathetic to Christianity as an answer. He argues that man achieves freedom from his mortality through religion. However, his solution neglects the limitations of faith for which one must necessarily limit their freedom. Belief in God usually also entails belief in doctrine to this effect. He does address this (P. 204) but defends Rank's belief that Christianity is a great ideal for this problem by claiming Rank was talking about Christianity as an ideal, not as practiced. I find this to be rather myopic. Perhaps this solution needs some recasting itself: the problem of mortality might explain the popularity of Buddhist thought (if not wholesale Buddhism) in Western society. With the tradition's rich contemplative tradition, Buddhist philosophy pushes one to accept his mortality, not by transference to a source of immortality, but by accepting with grace his humanly limitations and the transience of all things. One need not become a Buddhist at all to appreciate the freedom one gains by such acceptance, and Becker shows us why. (Perhaps Becker would not have foreseen the popularity of Buddhist philosophy when he discusses Tillich and reduces Eastern philosophy to "mysticism," which Tillich believed was not for the Western man.)</p>
                    <p>This brings us back to Samir Chopra, who included "Buddhism" in his study of "philosophical doctrines" as the only exception to his selection of Western (white, male) thought. In fact, I think <i>The Denial of Death</i> makes Chopra's book quite superfluous: Becker's chapter on Kierkegaard, for instance, was a more insightful and closer-to-the-text discussion of Kierkegaard's thoughts about anxiety, dread, and mortality. Likewise, after reading about the neo-Freudians' existential recasting, it seems only more absurd that Chopra would draw on Freud directly as he did, and pay no heed to the developments on his thought.</p>
                    <p>In 1973, the prevalence of Freudian psychology probably made <i>The Denial of Death</i> a more relevant read, though still quite sympathetic to Freud. Perhaps this is less than ideal. Recall, for instance, Betty Friedan's discussion of some of the outcomes of reductive and misogynistic Freudian thought in <i>The Feminine Mystique</i> 10 years prior. When reading <i>The Denial of Death</i> today, I wonder: once developed past his thoughts, why did neo-Freudians still attach themselves to Freud's language? One example that comes to mind is the "castration complex," which, once recast as a "disillusionment with the body," has nothing at all to do with "castration." Indeed, even Becker himself seems quite attached to Freud when, despite repeatedly calling out the persistent faults in his ideas, he nevertheless refers to him as "possibly the greatest psychologist who's ever lived."</p>
                    <p>To say that clinical psychology has taken leaps and bounds since this book was written is profoundly an understatement. Even within the limits of my knowledge, the ninth chapter of <i>The Denial of Death</i>, which aims to provide a "general view" of mental illness, struck me as overly reductive when insightful, and often as blatantly wrong. Becker's summaries of depression and schizophrenia are misrepresentative. For instance, cases of creative output from individuals with schizophrenia refute Becker's dichotomy between the artist/genius and the schizophrenic. As opposed to the artist, Becker defines the schizophrenic as the "uncreative psychotic," someone who's "erupting meanings cannot be given any creative form." This is obviously incorrect: consider TempleOS for example, a project of breath-taking scale that certainly gave voice to Terry Davis's mind. Similarly, Becker's discussion of "perversions" and homosexuality (which occurs elsewhere in the book as well) is an obvious case of it's outdatedness. Framing modern homosexuality as "Greek manqu&eacute;" was oddly hellenophilic and quite ugly. I think this entire chapter may be disregarded without the slightest loss to the reader.</p>
                    <p>In his conclusion, Becker discusses the means by which psychotherapy and psychology can become a religion; he argues that scientific study alone creates a void once it has demolished religious mythology, one that can be fulfilled by a religion of psychology. Perhaps Becker's venerations of Freud indicate some degree in which this is internalized. He does not take a stance on the validity of such a psychology-religion, only that it's a "logical" outcome. Indeed, such criteria are the means by which people make many such "private religions." Along this vein, I also quiet enjoyed reading Becker's pointed criticisms of utopian thinkers (Brown, Marcuse) who's formulations for a humanity free of death-anxiety depended on incorrect assumptions of the root cause of death-anxiety and repression. Repression, Becker says, is not simply the result of childhood development, but a product of the facing-up to life: "life itself is the insurmountable problem."</p>
