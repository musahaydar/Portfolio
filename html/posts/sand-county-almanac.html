                    <p>I think <i>A Sand County Almanac</i> is remarkable for its form. The book's implicit task, which ultimately defines guiding principles for conservation, is to convince us of both the urgency and personal relevance of the problem. For those of us who have never witnessed the Silphium in bloom or have means to recall the "smoky gold" of Tamarack needles in autumn, conservation may seem an abstract concept with remote impact. Had Aldo Leopold opened with the essays he postponed until the final part, perhaps he would have lost many such readers.</p>
                    <p>Thus, Leopold's first task is to make relevant his theories of the land ethic or the value of wilderness. In contrast to the doctrinal essays of the final part, most of the book consists of stories. Take his descriptions of the convention of geese in March or the male woodcock's dance in April. Or, as a particularly memorable example, he illustrates the decades a tree had witnessed through each successive stroke of a saw through its rings.</p>
                    <p>The book's second part, "Sketches Here and There," proceeds like the first, though now organizing his sketches over place instead of time. The effect of this is to broaden the scope and variety of these experiences. Here, Leopold more tells us why these stories matter: he writes that the Escdulla mountain in Arizona "still hangs on the horizon, but when you see it you no longer think of bear. It's only a mountain now." In another chapter: "Despite many opportunities to do so, I have never returned to the White Mountain. I prefer not to see what tourists, roads, sawmills, and logging railroads have done for it, or to it." These words linger. Even if we've never had these particular experiences firsthand, we have a taste of what's at stake.</p>
                    <p>This finally motivates his concluding essays in the third part. "Land, like Odysseus' slave-girls, is still property. The land-relation is still strictly economic, entailing privileges but not obligations," he writes in "Land Ethic." Why should one believe in an alternative land-relation? Because of the consequences on wildlife and on our experience of the natural world. How can one know such experiences if not first hand? This is the objective of Leopold's Almanac and "Sketches Here and There."</p>
                    <p>There are countless things we can experience only through past writing: Leopold elegizes the Passenger Pigeon in one chapter (as I wrote this, a friend mentioned Thoreau's description of flocks of these pigeons in the forest). I wonder how many more of these experiences we will lose, how many experiences will exist only as recorded or described, in books like <i>A Sand County Almanac</i>, if we do not take collective responsibility for their protection.</p>
