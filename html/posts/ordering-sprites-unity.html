                      A common problem immediately facing the developer of a top-down 2D game in Unity is sprite layering.
                      For example, you may want some GameObjects to render in front or behind the player, depending on where the player is relative to the object.
                      Following are two methods which I've used to implement this behavior. Both work by modifying the
                      <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Renderer-sortingOrder.html"><span class="code_inline">sortingOrder</span> of the Sprite Renderer</a> component.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Absolute Sorting Order</h3>
                    <p>
                      The first method, and my preferred method, is what I call "Absolute Sorting Order." This method sets the <span class="code_inline">sortingOrder</span>
                      based on the y position of the GameObject. Following is the complete <span class="code_inline">AbsoluteSortingOrder.cs</span> script. This script should be
                      attached to every object on the same sorting layer as the player, including the player.
                    </p>
                    <div class="code_block"><pre>
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class AbsoluteSortingOrder : MonoBehaviour {

    public float offset;
    SpriteRenderer spr;

    void Start() {
        spr = gameObject.GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>();
    }

    //sets an objects sorting order relative to its Y position
    void Update() {
        spr.sortingOrder = (Mathf.RoundToInt((transform.position.y + offset) * 100f) / 4) * -1;
    }
}</pre></div>
                    <p>
                      This method provides the following advantages: firstly, it sorts all objects based on their position, so any object can be moved during runtime, and it will automatically
                      appear in front of or behind any other objects which it is in front of or behind, respectively, as long as they also have this script attached. It may be possible to overflow the
                      <span class="code_inline">sortingOrder</span> using this script, since it does not constrain the <span class="code_inline">sortingOrder</span> to any maximum value. So far, I have
                      not made a scene large enough for this to be a problem, but it's something to keep in mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This script also provides a useful feature: suppose you want to define a point at which one object should be considered in front of or behind another. For example,
                      in the gif at the top of this page, we might want the player to be considered "behind" the tree as soon as the bottom of the player's sprite passes the bottom of the
                      tree's sprite. In order to achieve this behavior, we can add an <span class="code_inline">offset</span> value. The <span class="code_inline">offset</span> for a particular
                      object can be set in the Unity editor, ideally on the prefab of the object. Setting it to a negative value decreases the value of the <span class="code_inline">sortingOrder</span>
                      and the opposite. Thus, if we want to make the tree sprite sort based on the bottom of the sprite instead of the center (or whichever point <span class="code_inline">transform.position.y</span>
                      is derived), we can set the <span class="code_inline">offset = -0.2</span>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Relative Sorting Order</h3>
                    <p>
                      The previous method which I used is what I call "Relative Sorting Order." Here, we have the player remain on some predefined sorting order, say 5. Then, we have any GameObjects
                      which we want to sort relative to the player have the following script, called <span class="code_inline">RelativeSortingOrder.cs</span>:
                    </p>
                    <div class="code_block"><pre>
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class RelativeLayer : MonoBehaviour {
    public float offset;
    public int layerAdjHi = 0, layerAdjLo = 0;
    public string targetTag = "Player";

    GameObject target;
    SpriteRenderer sprRenderer;
    float buffer = 0.05f;

    void Start(){
        sprRenderer = this.gameObject.GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>();
        target = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag(targetTag);
    }

    void Update(){
        if(target == null) {
            target = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag(targetTag);
        }
        else {
            if (target.transform.position.y >= (gameObject.transform.position.y + offset + buffer)) {
                sprRenderer.sortingOrder = 8 + layerAdjHi;
            } else {
                sprRenderer.sortingOrder = 3 + layerAdjLo;
            }
        }
    }
}</pre></div>
                    <p>
                      This script is quite a bit more complex, and the behavior can be less than desirable. For instance, it only allows an object to sort relative to a single object, which we
                      find using a tag (this script in particular looks for the tag <span class="code_inline">"Player"</span>). To work around this, there are two "adjustment" values, called
                      <span class="code_inline">layerAdjHi</span> and <span class="code_inline">layerAdjLo</span>, for the higher and lower <span class="code_inline">sortingOrder</span>s respectively.
                      These values could be adjusted to make sure that if two objects overlap, they sort onto the correct layers relative to each other as well as to the target. This script similarly
                      provides the <span class="code_inline">offset</span> functionality as above.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Besides the fact that this script avoids the potential overflow problem in the Absolute Sorting Order (again, I've not had this issue and it's likely an easy fix), it's clearly
                      the worse choice. For example, if your game should have an NPC, or any other GameObject which moves around the level, the script will not sort the objects relative to them, only the
                      player. It also has the advantage of allowing hardcoded <span class="code_inline">sortingOrder</span> values, which means that objects which do not conform to this sprite
                      sorting scheme can be sorting accordingly to those values. However, these same behaviors can be achieved with the Absolute Sorting Order method as well, perhaps using different
                      sorting layers or sprite masks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I've included this method here to show a previous attempt of mine to solve this sprite ordering problem and explain it's drawbacks. You should probably use the Absolute Sorting Order
                      method if you find it useful.
