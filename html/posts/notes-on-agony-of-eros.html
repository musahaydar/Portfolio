                    <div class="quote"><p>"You could be a respectable 'holistic' (as it were) chemist before chemistry began to expose the structure of the elements, but, once such an advance has been made, to insist on the holistic approach is obscurantist." -G. A. Cohen</p></div>
                    <p>I didn't like Byung-Chul Han's <i>The Agony of Eros</i>. Although I read it a while ago, I'm driven to write a few brief notes on why. My purpose is not to discount all of Byung-Chul Han's ideas, only some of them presented in this book and, more generally, his methodology.</p>
                    <p>When this book was recommended to me, and when another of Han's books was recommended later, both recommenders described the books as difficult and "academic." I will grant the former but not the latter. Its difficulty stems not from its "philosophical rigor" (as Alain Badiou put it in the introduction) but its lack thereof.</p>
                    <p>The major issue with Byung-Chul Han's writing is the lack of definitions, or clarity in use, of his terms. He writes about "negativity," the "atopic Other," "Eros," etc, never defining these concepts. Those familiar with the split between continental and analytic philosophy would not find this surprising, since Han primarily studied German literature and philosophy. I found it very amusing when Badiou pointed to a "striking quotation from Deleuze and Guattari" as evidence for <i>The Agony of Eros</i>'s rigor. It's ironic. (But, to be clear, I am presently still interested by the work of Deleuze and his ideas, despite the obfuscation in his writing.)</p>
                    <p>The work of Han's reader then becomes to figure out what he's saying in the first place. It was G. A. Cohen who noted that, when one takes up such a challenge, he may have a sense of having grasped an important or major idea. But this may be a conflation between the quality of the idea and the sense of achievement at merely having understood it. It was a coincidence that I first encountered the work of G. A. Cohen shortly after having read <i>The Agony of Eros</i>, but his preface to <i>Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence</i> is a must-read for the terms he provides when differentiating analytical Marxism from "bullshit Marxism," ideas which generalize.</p>
                    <p>The second problem with <i>The Agony of Eros</i> is the methodology. The worst offense was citing a quotation from Freud to explain the functioning of a cognitive process, as though in 2012 there hadn't been decades of development in psychology and cognitive science. (And like Samir Chopra's book I wrote about at the beginning of the year, it's once again Freud). But this is an example of his method: Han relies on citations from famous philosophers to support his arguments. It is un-systematic and methodologically outdated. Likewise, discussion of a film does not also generalize to a very convincing argument about the functions of society, yet it is presented as such.</p>
                    <p>Finally, when one takes some time to pick apart what Han is actually trying to say, greatly obscured by his language as it is, I think some of his ideas are bad. Not all of them: there's something to his ideas about sexuality as commodity and about the reduction of people to a "consumable sameness" so that they can be commoditized, for instance (but in order to have this conversation, we first have to establish what we think Han means). </p>
                    <p>But on some of his other ideas: his assumptions (which are not defended) about the disappearance of distance and how it affects the possible depth of love are a bit strange. Then, making claims like love once represented "plot, narration, or drama" stands for an unrealistic and unhelpful romanticization of the past. I also felt that Han leaned into blaming individuals for the isolating circumstances forced upon them by social circumstances (though I didn't record where I got this impression). </p>
                    <p>My point here is that these ideas are obscured by the language with which he writes, and even if one enjoys the challenge of picking them out, I think it's hardly worth the effort. I think <i>The Agony of Eros</i> is an excellent example of obscurantist writing and outdated philosophical methodology obscuring vague and poorly-thought-out ideas. There are better ideas in the works of writers who are far more clear and consistent in their terms and arguments.</p>
