                    <p>Following is an analogy I devised between Google Image Search and using so-called generative AI to produce images. This was from an earlier version of my <a href="https://culturajournal.com/article-view/?id=1449">Cultura paper</a> on the limitations in making representational art with generative AI. It didn't make it into the final paper but I think this analogy holds some weight.
                    <div class="thin"><hr /></div>
                    <p>We can draw an analogy between generative AI and searching Google for images, both as processes of expressive selection: just as one may tweak his prompt until a suitable image is generated, one adjusts her Google search query to find an acceptable image. Generally, Google searching is not considered a creative (and therefore neither an artistic nor expressive) process because the images produced are preexisting. Yet, this process involves searching and adjusting until a suitable image is found, closest to that which the searcher seeks to express. Indeed, one often searches Google for an image with which they hope to express something, albeit via an image not of their own creation. Though Google searching is not a creative process, it is an expressive one.</p>
                    <p>We tend to consider generative AI creative since the images it produces do not exist prior to their generation. Does generative AI being creative imply that it is therefore more expressive than a Google search? If a generative AI tool can only produce images based on its model and training data, then the processes are quite similar: in using Google search, a user is selecting among the existing images that Google's web crawler can find. In using generative AI, he is selecting from the existing space of images possibly generated by that particular generative AI model and training data. Of course, a Google search query and a generative AI prompt are different, both in their formatting, and the process by which they are revised when none of the resulting images are suitable. However, prompting likewise varies between the various generative AI tools. In each case, crafting the most effective prompt is an expressive process, and though Google search queries are often simpler, the process by which one creates one is similar. In each case, the user expresses himself through the prompt or query, yet the resulting image—whether found by Google's crawler or generated by an algorithm—was not created by the user.</p>
                    <p>However, it would be inaccurate to conclude that both generative AI and Google image search results are therefore equal in their expressive potential. As generative AI generalizes, these tools become vastly more capable of accurately generating the images one describes. The fact that generative AI prompts tend to be longer and more descriptive is also indicative of a difference. Generally speaking, generative AI is often much more capable of generating images close to the provided description than Google search is capable of finding, especially as the prompts become increasingly specific (hence the excitement towards generative AI). For some use cases, such as when the prompts describe something that was not included in the model's training data, Google search may produce more appropriate results. But for the general case, generative AI's broader space of possible images and greater degree of prompt specificity means it allows greater degree of expression. However, both generative AI and Google search lack expressiveness compared to other mediums as it occurs in the features of the image created.</p>
